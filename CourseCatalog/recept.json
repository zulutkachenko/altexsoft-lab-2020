      "Description": "Kharcho soup, recipe with chicken. Delicious, aromatic, spicy. In fact, this is a beef soup, but Georgians often cook kharcho soup from chicken.",
      "Cooking": "Rinse the chicken and cut into portions. Pour 2.5 liters of boiling water over the chicken and cook until tender (30-40 minutes) over medium heat, covered. Rinse the rice. Place the washed rice in the broth. When it starts to swell (after 10-15 minutes), add salt to the soup. Peel, wash and finely chop the onions and carrots. Peel the garlic and chop finely. Heat the butter in a skillet. Saute vegetables over medium heat, stirring for 2-3 minutes. Add tomato paste before finishing frying. Transfer the garlic to the pan with the vegetables. Simmer the vegetables together for about 5-7 minutes over the lowest heat, stirring occasionally. Transfer vegetables to soup."
